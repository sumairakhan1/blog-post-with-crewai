## 🛠️ Troubleshooting  

### ❌ `ImportError: cannot import name 'kickoff'`  
✔️ Ensure `flow1.py` is inside `src/my_crewai_project/`  
✔️ Ensure `__init__.py` is present in `src/my_crewai_project/`  
✔️ Update `pyproject.toml` to:  
```toml
[project.scripts]
blogpost = "src.my_crewai_project.flow1:kickoff"
```
